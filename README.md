# Slacker

Slacker is a theme for Vencord/BetterDiscord based on the 2023 Slack redesign on macOS.

# Disclaimer

I quickly made this theme in an evening for me because I like Slack's redesign. The goal of this theme isn't to be a complete redesign but rather to grab the few elements of Slack's redesign I like (use of vibrancy/shadows) and apply theme to Discord. There's probably a way to adapt this for Windows but I don't use it enough to justify spending time porting it there.

If you run into issues, feel free to let me know.

# Installation

Grab the `slacker.theme.css` file from this repo and put it in your themes folder. I might publish it on BetterDiscord when this theme is more fleshed out.
